This seven segment display module is specifically designed to work with *POS* systems and banking applications. Initially, this module is developed to work with PC based systems, and later it was modified to work with other platforms and applications.

To simplify the communication interface this unit emulates a *COM* port in the host terminal. Because of this feature, this module can work with many systems without having any additional device driver(s).

This display module is designed around *STM32F103CB* MCU. The firmware of this display unit operates with most of the *STM32F103C* series MCUs, which including *STM32F103C8T6* based Blue Pill board.
