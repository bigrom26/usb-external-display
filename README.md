This seven segment display module is specifically designed to work with *POS* systems and banking applications. Initially, this module is developed to work with PC based *POS* systems, and later it was modified to work with other applications.

To simplify the communication interface this unit emulates a *COM* port in the host terminal. Because of this feature, this module can work with many systems without having any additional device driver(s).

This display module is designed around *STM32F103CB* MCU. The firmware of this display unit operates with most of the *STM32F103C* series MCUs, which including *STM32F103C8T6* based Blue Pill board. 

This is open source hardware project.
